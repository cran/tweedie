CHANGE LOG (incomplete)

* Version 2.0.0
  - Made  m,ethod="inversion" the default (was "series")
  - Slightly changed default output (added sep="" to some paste commands)

* Version 1.6.9 
  - An error introduced earlier (unsure when exactly; prob v 1.6.1)
  - In trying to identify and fix the error, tidied some of the FORTRAN code
  - Made  do.smooth=TRUE  the default (was FALSE)
  - If  p.vec  is not supplied,  tweedie.profile  makes a sensible guess
  - Made  verbose=FALSE the default  (was TRUE)
  - Made minor changes to output when  verbose=FALSE

* Version 1.6.8
  - Correct error in dtweedie.saddle y=0 for 1<p,2 
    (Thanks to Glenn Meyers <GMeyers@iso.com>)
  
* Version 1.6.7
  - Correct error in rtweedie when power=1 and phi\ne 1 
    (Thanks to Frederic Gosselin <frederic.gosselin@cemagref.fr>)
  
* Version 1.6.6
  - Corrected specification of GPL; no changes to functionality, code or documentation
  
* Version 1.6.5
  - In dtweedie, added power==3 (inverse Gaussian) as a special case
  - Minor change in documentation

* Version 1.6.4
  - Added  data, weights, and  offset  input arguments
  - Fixed a bug where "=>" was used rather than ">="
  
* Version 1.6.3
  - Fixed a bug in tweedie.profile: exact zeros still allowed p=2 (but not p>2)
  
* Version 1.6.2
  - Fixed a bug in  ptweedie.inversion  where variable  cdf  was undefined
  - Fixed a bug in  qtweedie  where any(power)<1  should have been  any(power<1)

* Version 1.6.1
  - Fixed error in tweedie.f  (twice) where a float was used in a do-loop


* Version 1.6
  - Fixed a bug in ptweedie: It now returns 0 when y<0 (rather than reporting an error)
  - Fixed a bug in ptweedie.inversion: y.len was undefined
  - Fixed a bug in dwteedie.inversion: if( any(phi<0) ) written as if (any(phi) <0 )


Built for R version 2.6.0
* Version 1.5.3:
  - Changed the tweedie.plot to produce no default x and y labels
  
* Version 1.5.2: 
  Built for R version 2.5.1
  - Removed the inversion computation from the example for  dtweedie;
    it was very slow and hence caused problems

* Version 1.5.1: 
  Built for R version 2.5.0
  - Fixed citation details
  - Added note in dtweedie help page indicating where the methods
    are defined (Dunn and Smyth, 2007).
  - Added tweedie-package.Rd
  - Fixed a small bug in  dtweedie.inversion (replaced  p  with   power)

* Version 1.5: 2007/May/02
  Built for R version 2.5
  - Made change to use of pmatch in function  tweedie
  - Swapped the order of methods 1 and 2 in the call of
    tweedie.inversion  to make consistent with a change
    in the associated paper Dunn and Smyth.
  - Fixed an uninitialized variable error in the FORTRAN code
    which sometimes caused the inversion procedure to fail.
  - Other minor changes (fixing spelling errors, updated
    Dunn and Smyth reference; etc.)

* Version 1.4:  2006/12/04
  
  - Some very minor changes (some cosmetic) in the code
  - Made the code more robust, exiting gracefully when Inf and NA appear
    in the computed log-likelihood
  - Slightly changed the output plot in tweedie.profile, to reflect
    that some value of  p.vec  may not have a corresponding likelihood
    computed accurately (or, indeed, at all)
  - Added new function   tweedie.plot  to make it easier to plot Tweedie
    densities

  
* Version 1.02: tweedie_1.02.tar.gz:  
  Built for R version 2.0.0
  
  Major fix
  - The mle estimate of phi was incorrect in tweedie.profile 
    (thanks Sarah Lennox, QDPI&F) 
  Minor changes:
  - Some better warnings in  tweedie.profile
  New features
  - tweedie.profile now allows the actual computed points to
    be added to the plot using the  do.points  option (default 
	 is TRUE)
  - The tweedie.profile function now smooth and computes 
    confidence intervals even when the computed likelihood 
	 values contain Infs or NAs.

* Version 1,01: tweedie_1.01.tar.gz:  
  Built for R version 1.9
  
  Minor fixes:
  - fixed a bug in rtweedie: it failed for p=2 (thanks 
    Sarah Lennox, QDPI&F)
  - fixed a bug in qtweedie: it failed in some cases
   (thanks Gordon Smyth, WEHI)
  - added a proper  .First.lib  function (!) (thanks to
    James Wettenhall and Gordon Smyth, WEHI)
  - other minor bugs fixed
  - the  tweedie  family function removed, and package
    made dependent on the  statmod  package
  - updated for R version 1.9

* Version 1.0: tweedie_1.0.tar.gz:  
  Built for R version 1.7
