1.5: 2007/May/02
  - Made change to use of pmatch in function  tweedie
  - Swapped the order of methods 1 and 2 in the call of 
    tweedie.inversion  to make consistent with a change
    in the associated paper Dunn and Smyth.
  - Other minor changes (fixing spelling errors, updated
    Dunn and Smyth reference; etc.)

1.4:  2006/12/04
  
  - Some very minor changes (some cosmetic in the code)
  - Made the code more robust, exiting gracefully when Inf and NA appear
    in the computed log-likelihood
  - Slightly changed the output plot in tweedie.profile, to reflect
    that some value of  p.vec  may not have a corresponding likelihood
    computed accurately (or, indeed, at all)
  - Added new function   tweedie.plot  to make it easier to plot Tweedie
    densities
